This is in the Arduino IDE Code editor
Used Arduino Uno as I just wanted to see if it could be coupled easily. aka wire up loadcells without the HX Amplifiers as these load cells are Digital output.
ZIP FILE HAS PICTURES OF HOW I CONNECTED THINGS AROUND, sorry if wires are hard to follow, limited on the wires but i tried to take apicture of eac junction.
